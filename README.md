# Earthquake-Visualization-with-Leaflet-and-Javascript

* Visualizeed an earthquake JSON dataset from USGS.
* Using Leaflet, created a map that plots all the earthquakes from the dataset based on their longitude and latitude.
* Data markers reflected the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.
* Included popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.
* Created a legend to provide context for the map data.
